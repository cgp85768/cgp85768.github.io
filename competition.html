	Competition

	<p>
	Saturdays. To many, it is just a day of the week, but to me, it&#39s a day of family, fun, and competition. It&#39s a day of college football, the smell of too many foods to count, and the sound of blaring music vibrating my house. My sleeves are rolled up, my hair is in a bun, and my hands won&#39t stop sweating. As I look across the ping pong table at my brother, my biggest competitor, all I can think about is how badly I want to win. My ultimate goal of success is winning. It is match point, and I can feel my heart sink into my stomach. I vividly remember the feeling of serving the ball and winning the game 21-19. My first victory against my brother after 17 years. As I run around my house screaming, waving my hands, I realize I am more competitive than most people. Although winning a game of ping pong on that unforgettable Saturday is a goal I was proud to accomplish, I realized during my victory lap around my house, this moment was about much more. My excitement didn&#39t come from playing games, being competitive, or even winning. Instead, the joy I was experiencing was a result of all the great times I&#39ve had with my brother after years of Saturdays. All of the endless laughs and jokes, countless all-nighters watching favorite movies, and the multitude of childhood games we&#39ve played are the memories I will cherish forever.

	As a freshman in college, I understand I have a lot more to learn and much more space to grow. My whole future awaits me and although I do not know what that future holds, I know I will take what is given and organize it into a beautiful story- my story. If I was to be asked what quality makes me different, I would proudly say that I can full heartedly give something everything I&#39ve got and continue to make things better. On a personal note, I am someone who likes to have everything in order. I make lists everyday and drive myself to complete that list by the end of the day. Competition has always been a big part of my life and my competitive spirit allows me to keep pushing towards perfection and completing my goals. To me, anything can be like competing against my brother; you dig deep and keep trying because there is always room for improvement.
