<h2> Injuries </h2> 
<p>
<q>Hurry we are going to the hospital!</q> I remember hearing my dad say as I have one thousand thoughts running through my head. What started out as a fun summer day riding my four-wheeler when I was five years old resulted in a broken femur bone, which landed me in the hospital with a metal pin in my leg. Two surgeries later, I had a full body cast and a wheelchair and crutches. A limp developed and the doctors said I may not be able to walk normally. However, I kept my faith and continued with therapy and my legs grew to be even, allowing me to do anything I wanted to do. From an early age, it became clear to me that life is a series of hurdles, giving me the choice to be stopped by them or overcome them.

During my junior year, my world was rocked once more when I discovered that I would not be playing tennis due to a bulging disc in my lower spine. As the number one varsity singles player, I was devastated, but instead of letting it have a negative impact on me, I saw it as an opportunity. I knew I still wanted to contribute and be a part of the team, so I began coaching and mentoring the other players. This was a life changing moment as I realized that I would love to coach tennis in the future. Even though I wasn&#39t able to play, I feel like it was one of my most positive seasons yet.

 Many might consider the obstacles I have faced to have a negative impact on how I view life, but I know that these events have helped build my character by giving me tenacity, grit, and resilience. I am stronger and realize we must live each day to the fullest. As a result, I find joy in all things and there isn&#39t a day where I don&#39t give everything my very best. I am truly thankful for the hurdles of my life and look forward to embracing future challenges with strength and success.
