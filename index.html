	<h3> About Me </h3>
	
	<p>
	Hello! My name is Catherine Paige. I am from Dalton, Georgia, a small city in North Georgia. I graduated from Christian Heritage School and I now am a freshman at the University of Georgia. 
	Ever since high school, I have been involved in many activites. I am currently involved in a few things such as Greek Life and UGA Miracle and I plan on getting involved even more. You can see what school activities I did in high school <A href = "schoolactivities.html">HERE.</A> 
	I am a hardworker who is able to manage important tasks and that is why I think I would be a great counselor.
	
	<p> Some important characteristics that make me stand out is my competitive spirit, my perserverance, and my leadership skills. 
	Competition has always been an important aspect of my life and it is a big part of who I am. You can learn a little bit more about my competitive spirit <A href = "competition.html">HERE.</A> 
	From a young age, I have been challenged to overcome many obstacles in my life. For starters, I broke my femur bone when I was 5 and overcame the possibility of never being able to run or play sports again. Recently, I have been dealing with a back injury and other medical issues. You can learn more about these injuries <A href = "injury.html">HERE.</A>

	<h3> My Passion </h3> 
	<p>
	I have always known I wanted to be a child counselor. I have a heart for helping people, I love kids, and I enjoy being around them. I have been around kids my whole life, and I have built many strong relationships with children. I have had some shadowing experience with a counselor at Park Creek Elementary and I plan on shadowing her more in the future. I know I would make a great counselor and it is something I would <em> truly enjoy </em> doing. I know I would make a great counselor and I will do whatever it takes to reach my goal. 
	<br> Below is a table of the dates and the times I have shadowed and what I have learned from those experiences.
